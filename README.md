## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment
### Assignment #211 Automation Presentation
Objectives:

* Work with multiple media applications to present student automation assignment

Now that you have a working automation, we will be creating a presentation to showcase your working bot along with the code.  You will also get a chance to describe challenges that you faced while working with this program as well as where you might go if you were to continue working on this project in the future.  We will be working with a few applications that are on your computer, or that you can download and install on your computer at home:

* OBS Studio - this is really a live streaming and recording suite but we can also use it for recording your desktop
* Openshot Video Editor - this is just a video editor that allows you to place and edit multiple video tracks. We will use it primarily for cropping your video or adding titles if you want

Assignment:

Some information you will need to include in your presentation:
* Description of the game.  Some of the things you might address include: What makes the game suitable for a click bot?  What did you like about the game?  How detailed/advanced is the game?
* Your approach to automation.  Did you use coordinates or look for images on screen?  Did you include an option to do upgrades or play minigames?  How did you decide when to do other things in game?
* A video clip that shows your screen with your bot along with the code running beside it.  This is where having a split screen with the bot on one side and Visual Studio Code on the other side would be helpful
* What were some of the challenges that you ran into?
* What would you do to expand or improve on your bot?
